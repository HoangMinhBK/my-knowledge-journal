# Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm

### My Note:
In a technical interview, I was asked how to detect whether a linked list has a loop. My initial approach was to use a visited map to check if a node was visited twice. However, this solution gave me an O(n) space complexity. The interviewer then hinted at a better approach. So we have this:

### How It Works:
The Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm, also called the “tortoise and hare” method, is designed to detect cycles in linked lists or sequences. It works by using two pointers: one that moves quickly (the “hare”) and another that moves more slowly (the “tortoise”). The fast pointer advances two steps at a time, while the slow pointer takes one step.

- **Cycle Detection:** If the two pointers eventually meet at the same node, it indicates the presence of a cycle since the fast pointer has caught up with the slow one.
- **No Cycle:** If the fast pointer reaches the end of the sequence (a `null` position), there is no cycle.

This algorithm offers a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1).

### Practical Applications:
Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm can be applied in various real-world scenarios:

1. **Memory Management:** In systems that use linked data structures, such as memory management or garbage collection algorithms, detecting cycles can help prevent memory leaks by identifying and handling circular references.

2. **Network Protocols:** In network protocols or routing algorithms, cycle detection ensures that routing loops are identified and resolved to prevent infinite loops and improve network efficiency.

3. **Software Testing:** In software testing, especially for applications that use complex data structures, cycle detection can be used to find and fix unintended cycles or loops that might cause performance issues or bugs.

4. **Graph Algorithms:** Floyd's Cycle Detection is useful in graph algorithms where detecting cycles is crucial, such as in scheduling tasks, dependency resolution, and analyzing cyclic dependencies.
